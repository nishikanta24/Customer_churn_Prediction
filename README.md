This is my first machine learning project for Data analysis.
In this read me section ia m gonna share my learnings from this project.

# Telecom Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecom company using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify which customers are at risk of leaving the company and understand the factors contributing to their decision.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for telecom companies, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project explores a dataset containing various customer attributes, service usage patterns, and contract information to build predictive models that can identify customers likely to churn.

### Key Features:
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, data transformation, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for model training.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and understanding the impact of different features on customer churn.
- **Model Building:** Using machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict churn.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC curve.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of various features including:
- **Demographics:** Gender, SeniorCitizen status, Partner status, Dependents.
- **Services Signed Up For:** PhoneService, MultipleLines, InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies.
- **Account Information:** Contract type, PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges.
- **Target Variable:** Churn status.
